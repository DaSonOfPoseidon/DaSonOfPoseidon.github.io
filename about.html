        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Jackson. I'm 22 years old and currently a senior in Information Technology at Mizzou. I have experience building and deploying Python and C family applications on both desktop and web applications; you can check out my GitHub<!-- link to github --> to see what I've been working on recently.</p>
        <p>I currently work for Socket Fiber, where I wrote and maintain CalendarBuddy<!-- link to projects -->. I also provide advanced networking, provisioning, and other technical support to field technicians as needed.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy all things technology: writing software, playing video games, watching TV, building my homelab, and kitting out my "smart" home. I live with my fianc&eacute;, Emily, and our two children (cats), Oliver and Mae, who, quite frankly, are over my smart home shenanigans.</p>

        <h2>Resume Video</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Jackson... I enjoy building solutions to make people's lives easier, typically my own, but hey, like Bill Gates said, "I will always choose a lazy person for a difficult job because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it". I hope to work on technologies that are going to define tomorrow, whether that's monitoring for SMRs or guidance systems for ICBMs. I love a good challenge, and I'm always up to learning something new to solve a problem. I'd love to connect if that's something you're interested in!</p>
