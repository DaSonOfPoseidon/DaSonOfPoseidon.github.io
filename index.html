            GitHub Profile Snapshot
            These cards are live SVG images generated by github-profile-summary-cards
            (https://github.com/vn7n24fzkq/github-profile-summary-cards).
            They pull data from the GitHub API and render as <img> tags — no JavaScript required.
            Uses the "github_dark" predefined theme for dark-mode styling.

        <h3>Purpose and Goals</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to serve as a digital portfolio, allowing me to showcase my proudest accomplishments, toughest challenges, and favorite learning experiences.</p>
        <p>If you're an employer, I hope to show you who I am and why you should hire me, beyond bullet points on a resume. If you're a fellow technology lover, I hope to inspire you to follow your goals (that's cheesy). If we got into an argument on the internet, you googled me and found this: 1) I hope I was right; otherwise, this is awkward, and 2) I hope this shows you I know what I'm talking about.</p>
